This project is an attempt to create a simple neural net which can be used on the
MNIST dataset.
The implementation is based on a wonderful guide which can be found
[here](https://peterroelants.github.io/posts/neural_network_implementation_part01/).

### Where to obtain the MNIST dataset
The MNIST dataset can be downloaded from the [mnist database
homepage](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
